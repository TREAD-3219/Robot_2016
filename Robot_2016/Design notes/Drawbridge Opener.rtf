\f0\fs24 \cf0 Notes on a drawbridge opener\
\
In order to open the drawbridge, the robot must first engage the top of the drawbridge with the multi-tool drawbridge hook on the bottom end of the arms.  Then, it must back up while moving the arms down.  The downward movement will be slow at first, so the backing must be slow.  As it gets towards the drawbridge being down,  it can back faster, but it only needs to go back far enough that the drawbridge clears the bumpers.  The precision of the backup is not as critical as for the portcullis, because the arms can slide forward on the top of the drawbridge.  As long as the robot backs up far enough to let the drawbridge pass the bumpers, all is good.\
