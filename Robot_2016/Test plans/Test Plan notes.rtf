\f0\fs24 \cf0 Robot 2016 Test Planning notes\
\
The team needs to construct a detailed test plan for the robot.  It will need to include a schedule, allocation of robot and mule time, who is doing the testing, what each test is actually testing and how \'93success\'94 is determined.\
\
There should be a XX minute limit on robot time (10 minutes?) while there are multiple items to test.\
There should be rules about:\
a) how long a programmer can spend changing code during a test session\
b) how a programmer can extend their testing time and under what conditions\
c) Who gets the robot when a test slot is vacated\
d) what else?\
\
\
Testing will probably start in ernest on the main bot on Thursday (fingers crossed).\
Expect no more than 4 days!  Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Monday.  Tuesday will likely be needed for drive team tryouts.\
The programming team will need to share time with drive team applicants who will want drive practice.\
There will also need to be time allocated for drive team tryouts and selection. (Tuesday?)\
\
Each programmer should come up with the information for their components.\
Leads should integrate that information into a schedule.\
