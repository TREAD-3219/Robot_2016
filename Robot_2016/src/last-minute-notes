Things to check into, test and otherwise finish.
This is NOT a complete list!

First - 
check ALL the changes I made and make sure they don't break
anything that you did before.

Second -
prioritize the testing - what is most important?
Remember - the robot MUST work WELL under manual control to succeed.
The auto parts should also work, but we will NOT have enough time
to test them.  There aren't buttons with the manual controls attached - 
those should be done and tested - they were done in the past but
taken out?

Does ANYONE have any un-integrated changes?  on which branch?
prioritize those changes - you only have 3 hours to test.

Does the robot move forward after the turn-to-goal during auto
to get within shooting range? (about 10-12 feet)

how far can the shooter throw? test!

The PID setup for the arm will need tweaking - be sure we have
dashboard variables for modifying them during testing.
